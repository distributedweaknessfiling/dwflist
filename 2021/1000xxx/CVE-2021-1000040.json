    "description": "DroidScript, all versions, were removed from the Google store after allegations of malware and ad fraud surfaced from Google. It is reported that ad clicking activity did take place but that it was not as a direct result from DriodScript themselves. However due to the removal of DroidScript it is unlikely that many DroidScript based applications will receive  security updates, creating a significant vulnerability (effectively an update freeze attack)."
