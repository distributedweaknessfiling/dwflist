# How to contact the Distributed Weakness Filing Project

There are several ways to contact us depending on what you need:

## File an issue here

File an issue here and we'll see it and respond, this is preferred as it's easily found, public, and other people can also chime in if needed.

## Contact project members directly

Most project members have an email address/twitter handle listed, however before contacting us personally please consider filing an issue first.
